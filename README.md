## Research on Android malware detection based on ML models & the weakness of DNNs in adversarial examples.


  The experiments are carried through the [Drebin dataset](https://www.sec.cs.tu-bs.de/~danarp/drebin/).
  
  
  1) preprocessing folder contains scripts related to dataset and its features.
  2) feature_based_original_dataset folder contains scripts for the experiments in whole feature space.
  3) feature_based_reduced_dataset folder contains scripts for the experiments on the reduced feature space.
  
  
  Each folder contains a README file to help you through the experiments.
